To start sbt:

1) If you have sbt - simply type "sbt"

2) If you don't have sbt - type "./sbt" (assuming you're on a Linux/OS X/*nix OS). Note that you may need to "chmod" to enable the script to be executable, e.g. "chmod 744 ./sbt"

Once sbt is running - type "run"

Applications that can be executed:

1) To train model - select "us.marek.meetup.w2v.W2VTraining"
